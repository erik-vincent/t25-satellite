<p>Based around Richard Sappia's SAT Tiny, I decided to build one but didn't want to the the Arduino IDE, preferring Atmel/Microchip Studio instead.
You can find Richard Sappia's version here: <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/174462-sattiny">https://hackaday.io/project/174462-sattiny</a></p>
<p>The idea of this mini project is to make two LEDs blink in a predefined pattern that looks similar to an exponential function given by an RC circuit, creating a smooth fading effect.</p>
<p>This is the code running on the SAT Tiny. Based on Richard Sappia's measurements, it has been observed that the current consumption remains around 4Î¼A when sleeping. During the day, when there is enough light to load the super cap, the Attiny wakes up every 8 seconds to checkout if PB3 is still high. In absence of light, PB3 sees a logical 0. At this point, the wake up interval changes to 4 seconds.</p>
